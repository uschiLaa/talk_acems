## Solution: Slice tour

Define slices based on the orthogonal distance of points from any projection plane, and visualize the result in an animated tour

## Curse of dimensionality paradox

- **Origin**: Bellman (1961) described difficulty of optimization in high dimensions given exponential growth in space
- **Consequence**: most points are far from the sample mean, near the edge of the sample space
- **Paradox**: using dimension reduction we instead get an excessive amount of observations near the center of the distribution, most projections are approximately Gaussian

## Concepts of projected volume


- To understand the piling near the center of projections, we can think about the high-dimensional volume projected onto a 2D area
- To impose rotation invariance and avoid edge effects, we start from a hypersphere in p dimensions

## Burning sage transformation

We can define a radial transformation that will redistribute the projected volume such that equal pD volume is projected onto equal 2D area

$$r'_y = R \sqrt{1-\left(1-\left(\frac{r_y}{R}\right)^2\right)^{p/2}}$$

## Sage tour

The new transformation is especially useful combined with a tour display, showing sequences of low-dimensional projections: for each new view we project the data to 2D and then show the sage display of the projected data

  img <- c(a, whitespace, b)
  image_append(img, stack = TRUE)

mouse_grand <- paste0(dir, "mouse_grand_2c-", frames, ".png")
mouse_grand_panel <- draw_frames(mouse_grand)
mouse_sage <- paste0(dir, "mouse_sage_2c_gam3-", frames, ".png")

## Discussion & Outlook

<br>

- We introduced a new display that is useful when visualizing high-dimensional data in low-dimensional projections
- This is especially useful in combination with a tour, implemented as the **sage tour** display
- A related approach is the **slice tour**
- These new displays are complementary to non-linear dimension reduction methods for visualization, e.g. t-SNE
- The displays should be implemented in an interactive interface for efficient tuning
- We can also think of new transformation and slicing methods
